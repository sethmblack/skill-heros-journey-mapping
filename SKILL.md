## The Monomyth Framework

Joseph Campbell identified a universal pattern underlying all hero myths across cultures. Every transformative experience—career change, relationship, creative endeavor, personal growth—follows this pattern.

### The Three Acts

**I. DEPARTURE (The Call)**
The hero is summoned to leave the ordinary world

**II. INITIATION (The Ordeal)**
The hero undergoes trials and transformation

**III. RETURN (The Gift)**
The hero brings back the boon to benefit others

### The 17 Stages

#### DEPARTURE (Stages 1-5)

**Stage 1: The Call to Adventure**
- Something disrupts ordinary life
- A herald appears (person, event, crisis, restlessness)
- The world feels too small or wrong
- *Signs:* Restlessness, dissatisfaction, sudden opportunity, growing awareness that something must change

**Stage 2: Refusal of the Call**
- Fear, doubt, obligation, comfort
- "I can't because..." thinking
- Negotiating with the call
- *Signs:* Making excuses, rationalizing the status quo, minimizing the call

**Stage 3: Supernatural Aid / Meeting the Mentor**
- Help arrives—often unexpected
- Teacher, book, experience, insight
- Protection and guidance offered
- *Signs:* Encountering wisdom, finding resources, receiving encouragement

**Stage 4: Crossing the First Threshold**
- Point of no return
- Commitment to the journey
- Leaving the known world behind
- *Signs:* Major decision, irreversible action, burning bridges

**Stage 5: Belly of the Whale**
- Complete separation from the old world
- Symbolic death of the old self
- Lowest point of departure
- *Signs:* Feeling lost, identity crisis, "what have I done?"

#### INITIATION (Stages 6-11)

**Stage 6: Road of Trials**
- Tests, ordeals, obstacles
- Learning through failure
- Allies and enemies revealed
- *Signs:* Repeated challenges, building skills, discovering who helps and who hinders

**Stage 7: Meeting with the Goddess**
- Experience of unconditional love
- Encounter with the sacred feminine
- Glimpse of what's possible
- *Signs:* Love, acceptance, inspiration, beauty, grace

**Stage 8: Woman as Temptress**
- Temptation to abandon the quest
- Distraction from the true goal
- Testing commitment
- *Signs:* Easy escape routes, attractive alternatives, "good enough" settling

**Stage 9: Atonement with the Father**
- Confrontation with ultimate authority/power
- Facing the deepest fear
- Reconciliation with what must be faced
- *Signs:* Showdown, reckoning, facing consequences

**Stage 10: Apotheosis**
- Death of the ego
- Transcendent understanding
- Elevation to a higher state
- *Signs:* Breakthrough, enlightenment, radical acceptance, peace

**Stage 11: The Ultimate Boon**
- The goal is achieved
- The treasure is found
- The gift is received
- *Signs:* Victory, accomplishment, receiving what was sought

#### RETURN (Stages 12-17)

**Stage 12: Refusal of the Return**
- Temptation to stay in the new world
- Reluctance to re-engage ordinary life
- "Why go back?"
- *Signs:* Withdrawal, isolation, staying in the breakthrough state

**Stage 13: The Magic Flight**
- Escape with the boon
- Dangers of the return journey
- Protecting what was won
- *Signs:* Racing to integrate, fear of losing the gain, obstacles to return

**Stage 14: Rescue from Without**
- Help needed to complete return
- Cannot do it alone
- The community reaches in
- *Signs:* Needing support, being called back, someone believing in you

**Stage 15: Crossing the Return Threshold**
- Integration of two worlds
- Translating wisdom for ordinary life
- The return is complete
- *Signs:* Communicating insights, practical application, rejoining community

**Stage 16: Master of Two Worlds**
- Freedom to move between ordinary and transcendent
- Competence in both realms
- Balance achieved
- *Signs:* Ease in both worlds, teaching others, embodied wisdom

**Stage 17: Freedom to Live**
- Living in the present moment

## Example

**Output:**

## Hero's Journey Map

### Your Current Situation
Left corporate career for entrepreneurship, now facing the reality of the journey—rejection, dwindling resources, doubt—but unable to return to the old life.

### Stage Diagnosis: Road of Trials
**Act:** Initiation
**Stage Number:** 6

### Why This Stage
You've definitively crossed the threshold (leaving the job) and passed through the Belly of the Whale (that initial "what have I done?" period). Now you're in the classic Road of Trials:
- Repeated tests (constant rejection)
- Resources being tested (savings running low)
- Learning through failure (each rejection teaches something)
- The old world is gone ("can't go back")

The fact that you can't return is significant—it means you've truly entered the adventure. There's no retreat, only forward.

### The Invitation of This Stage
The Road of Trials is where the hero is forged. Each rejection is not a sign you made a mistake—it's exactly what this stage looks like. You're being shaped by these trials. The question isn't whether you'll face obstacles; the question is what you'll become by meeting them.

Campbell said: "Opportunities to find deeper powers within ourselves come when life seems most challenging."

### What Comes Next
After sufficient trials, you'll encounter Stage 7: Meeting with the Goddess—an experience of unconditional support, a glimpse of what's possible, a moment of grace. Watch for it. It often comes unexpectedly—a client who believes in you, a mentor who appears, an insight that changes everything.

### Your Threshold Guardians
- **Fear of failure** - "Maybe I'm not cut out for this"
- **Scarcity thinking** - The savings countdown creating panic
- **Comparison** - Others who seem to have it figured out
- **The voice of the old world** - People who said you shouldn't have left

### Your Allies and Resources
- The skills you built in corporate (these are weapons for the new world)
- Others who've walked this path before (mentors, communities)
- The part of you that couldn't stay in the old life (that knowing)
- Each rejection is data, not verdict

### The Mythic Perspective
Every entrepreneur's journey echoes this pattern. The startup founders celebrated today faced their Road of Trials too. Odysseus didn't sail home without storms. The treasure isn't found in the ordinary world—it's found by going through the ordeal, not around it.

### Campbell's Counsel
"It is by going down into the abyss that we recover the treasures of life. Where you stumble, there lies your treasure."

The trials are not obstacles to your journey—they ARE the journey. Keep moving.
